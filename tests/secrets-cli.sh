#!/usr/bin/env bash
# End-to-end test for edit-secret / rekey-secrets against a real ragenix.
#
# This exists because of a bug that shipped: the generated agenix rules were a
# store file with repo-relative keys, and ragenix resolves a rule key relative
# to the *rules file's own directory* — so every key became
# /nix/store/secrets/<name>.age. `agenix -e` reported no rule for the file, and
# `agenix -r` skipped it as "does not exist, ignored" and exited 0. A rekey
# silently did nothing, which is precisely the failure this whole feature was
# built to make impossible.
#
# Usage: secrets-cli.sh <edit-secret.sh> <rekey-secrets.sh> <check-secrets.sh> <key-dir>
#
# <key-dir> holds the committed fixture keypairs alice/alice.pub, bob/bob.pub.
