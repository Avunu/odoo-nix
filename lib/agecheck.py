"""odoo-nix-agecheck — verify .age files are encrypted to their declared recipients.

An age file's header lists one stanza per recipient, in ASCII, before the
`---` line. For an SSH recipient the stanza carries a tag that is
`b64_nopad(sha256(<ssh wire blob>)[:4])` — derivable from the *public* key
alone. So the whole check runs offline, with no identity and no decryption.

This exists because the alternative failed in practice: a rules file can be
edited without re-encrypting the secrets, and nothing notices. In the repo this
tool was written for, a rotated key sat in `secrets.nix` for months while the
`.age` file was still encrypted to the key it replaced — the person it was
rotated *for* could not decrypt anything, and there was no signal.

Modes:
  check <rules.json> [--root DIR]   compare declared recipients to ciphertext
  explain <rules.json> <relpath>    why can't *I* decrypt this?
  tag <'ssh-ed25519 AAAA…'>         print one recipient tag
