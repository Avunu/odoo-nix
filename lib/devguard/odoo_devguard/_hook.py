"""Post-import hooks.

Python has no public "run this once module X has been imported" API, so this is
the usual shape: a meta-path finder installed at the front of ``sys.meta_path``
that, for registered names only, resolves the *real* spec and swaps in a loader
which fires callbacks after ``exec_module`` returns.

Resolving the real spec re-enters ``sys.meta_path`` and would find this finder
again, hence the ``_resolving`` guard.

Callbacks run inside the import, so an exception propagates as an ImportError
on the module being loaded — which is what makes the fail-closed behaviour in
the guards work.
